# Gamedev-Breakout-proj-3
Tools: Xcode, Spritekit

A cool clone of the Breakout game. Just a bunch of tiles on the top of the screen and a ball bouncing on all sides.

All you have to do is make sure the ball doesn't touch the end of the screen. 

references : tutorial for ios spritekit.

bugs: The ball doest move randomly. it just sticks to bouncing up and down. And you leaving the ball doesnt make you loose.
